# 🛡️ Simple Tool Kit – A Cybersecurity Tool for Beginners

**Simple Tool Kit** is a lightweight, beginner-friendly cybersecurity toolkit designed to help newcomers take their first steps in the field of ethical hacking and network security. Unlike complex professional tools, this project focuses on simplicity, clarity, and hands-on learning by bundling basic utilities into a single, easy-to-use package.

## 👥 Target Audience

This toolkit is ideal for:

- Students and enthusiasts who are just getting started with cybersecurity  
- People who have basic Linux/terminal skills and want to explore security tools  
- Self-learners or hobbyists looking for safe, offline security practice  
- Instructors or mentors teaching the fundamentals of ethical hacking

## 🧰 What’s Inside?

The toolkit includes several basic but essential cybersecurity tools for:

- IP and domain information gathering  
- Basic port scanning (using tools like `nmap`)  
- Whois lookups  
- DNS and HTTP header analysis  
- Encoding/decoding methods (Base64, ROT13, etc.)

> Built using **Python (≈85%)** and **Shell (≈14%)**, ensuring both portability and scriptability.

## 🔍 Why This Project?

Starting cybersecurity can be overwhelming. Most powerful tools are complex or require prior knowledge. Simple Tool Kit bridges the gap between learning and doing, offering a safe space to experiment and practice before diving into tools like Metasploit, Burp Suite, or Wireshark.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ctrl-alt-del-2010-developer/simple-tool-kit.git
   cd simple-tool-kit
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the toolkit:

   ```bash
   python3 toolkit.py
   ```

4. Select a tool from the menu — each is explained and beginner-friendly.

## 🚀 Future Plans

* Add more tools (e.g., vulnerability scanners, password crackers)
* GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt
* Multilingual support (English/Turkish)
* Logging, reporting features
* Educational platform integration

## 💻 Educational Value

Use the tools and **learn how they are built**. Code is simple, well-commented, and educational.

* Understand Python scripting for cybersecurity
* Learn network interaction via command-line
* Combine Bash and Python effectively

## 🧠 Philosophy

> Learn by building. Learn by using.

This toolkit is a **starting point** — a launchpad to bigger, more advanced tools. It’s designed for exploration, learning, and ethical use.
